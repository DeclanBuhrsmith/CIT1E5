# CIT1E5
[CIT1E5](https://declanbuhrsmith.github.io/CIT1E5/) is a web-app that takes the idea of a 15-minute city and allows the user to type in an address to figure out how walkable a specific location is.
Originally it was written using google apis, but I've rewritten it to use [Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), and [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/).

## Disclaimer
This application is not 100% given the crowd-sourced nature of the APIs used. Take the results with a grain of salt. Thanks for stopping by!
