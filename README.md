# CIT1E5
CIT1E5 is a web-tool that takes the idea of a 15-minute city and allows the user to type in an address to figure out how walkable a specific location is.
Originally it was written using google apis, but I've rewritten to use [Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), and [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/).
